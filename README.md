Flutter app for offline bird identification

For the detecting task, we uses pretrained model `ssd mobilenet`.

For the classification task, `ResNet34` model structure was adopted, take [MetaFGNet/L_Bird_pretrain/checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gsct7uWHYPfmNmFvLVHlgFqKOcoQRzs9) as a pretrained model, trained on [DongNiao DIB-10K](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344639013) using [Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/MetaFGNet](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/MetaFGNet).
